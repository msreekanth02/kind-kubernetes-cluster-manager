# 🎉 ARCHITECTURE.md Complete Rewrite - SUCCESS! 

## ✅ REWRITE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

I have **completely rewritten** the `ARCHITECTURE.md` file with proper Mermaid syntax that will render correctly on GitHub.

## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. **Removed HTML Tags**
- ❌ Eliminated all `<b>` and `<i>` HTML tags 
- ✅ Used standard Mermaid text formatting instead

### 2. **Fixed Subgraph Syntax**
- ❌ Removed complex nested subgraph structures that caused parsing errors
- ✅ Simplified subgraph definitions with proper quoted labels

### 3. **Corrected Styling**
- ❌ Removed font-size and font-weight properties (not supported in GitHub)
- ✅ Used clean classDef with fill, stroke, and stroke-width only

### 4. **Streamlined Diagrams**
- ✅ **7 Professional Diagrams** now properly formatted:
  1. **System Architecture** - High-level overview + Port mapping
  2. **Workflow Diagrams** - Cluster creation + Testing workflows  
  3. **Script Interactions** - Dependency graph
  4. **Network Architecture** - Internal Kubernetes networking
  5. **Data Flow** - MySQL persistence + Configuration flow
  6. **Storage Architecture** - PV/PVC + Data lifecycle
  7. **Security Model** - Multi-layer security + Certificate management
